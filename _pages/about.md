About me
------
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) under the supervision of Prof. [Ming Wen](https://mingwen-cs.github.io/). My research interests mainly focus on Software Security (in particular Fuzzing and Static Analysis), Software Supply Chain Security and Penetration Testing. I have submitted 50+ vulnerabilities on platforms such as edusrc and bilibilisrc, and also have obtained multiple CVE and CNVD identifiers.
